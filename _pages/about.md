About Me
======

My name is Albert, and I was born in Macau, I am currently a first-year student at Macau Polytechnic University, where I am pursuing a major in Computer Science. As part of my academic journey, I am building a strong foundation in programming and web development. At the moment, I am actively learning Python, which helps me understand problem-solving and logical thinking in coding, as well as HTML and CSS, which allow me to design and structure web pages with creativity and precision.
